# Welcome to the RTS Labs Code Challenge.

This project was created with a React Frontend and an Express and MongoDB backend.\
The frontend of this app is the deployed on Vercel is available here: [https://rts-labs-code-challenge.vercel.app/signin](https://rts-labs-code-challenge.vercel.app/signin).\
The backend of the project is deployed using Render and is connecting to MongoDB Atlas Cloud for the database.\
ATTENTION: When the app has been inactive for a period of time, Render spins down the backend so the first request made to sign in or sign up can take up to 50 seconds to complete in order to "wake up" render. After that initial request everything should be smooth! Cost of free deployments haha! Enjoy!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `node index.js`

Runs the backend of the app.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Tests are built wih Jest. 

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
